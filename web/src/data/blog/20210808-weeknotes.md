Spent large chunks of the week refreshing my memory on CSS basics, so this is CSS-heavy. ðŸ˜±

## CSS/Design

- Some CSS games!
  - [CSS grid quiz](https://www.euismod.dev) by [Etesam Ansari](https://www.etesam.dev/#/)
  - [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) by Codepip
  - [Gridbox Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) by Codepip
  - [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/) by Channing Allen
  - [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) by Luke Pacholski
  - [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/) by Kushagra Gour and Kushagra Agarwal
- Some CSS/design tools!
  - [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/)
  - [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/)
  - [CSS-Tricks Guides](https://css-tricks.com/guides/)
  - [CSS clip-path maker](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)
  - [CSS and SVG mask kitchen sink](https://codepen.io/yoksel/full/fsdbu)
  - [Can I Use?](https://caniuse.com/)
  - [Do I Use?](https://doiuse.herokuapp.com/)
- I like the idea of having a collection of sample layouts on the web that anybody can quickly grab and use as a starting point. Rachel Andrews has a [small collection](https://gridbyexample.com/patterns/) focused around grids, but I'm curious if there are more.
- Jen Simmons' [layout lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com/) is awesome. A master class in clean, responsive web design.

## Dev Experience

- TIL that [emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/) is a thing. TIL that it's already installed in my WebStorm. I am now 1% more productive.

## Misc.

- At one point I stumbled across a blog post that attempted to classify the different archetypes for web applications: a marketing site, a e-commerce site, a blog, etc etc. And then it attempted to determine what is the best approach for each: a SSG, a SPA, a CMS, etc etc. And now I can't find that post. ðŸ˜¢. I think someone diving deep on a list like that and approaching it with an academic-paper level of rigor would be awesome for the industry. But I can't find that damn post! All my search terms are at best getting me back different types of architecture, not different types of _use cases_.
  - [Andrew Parker](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/998005716/web-service-archetypes) seemed to have a version in 2010, although it's not as thorough as the one I originally saw.
