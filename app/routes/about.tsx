        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I've been a professional software engineer since 2010, working across
          the stack and focusing on technical leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work at Fractal, a venture studio starting startups from
          scratch, helping coach and advise our CTOs as they create something
          out of nothing. I've previously worked at Blackbaud, Spanning, CA
          Technologies, and other companies through contract work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider myself a true full-stack engineer, focusing on whatever
          programming language or tool will get the job done. I believe the best
          software engineers are the ones who resist becoming "code monkeys" and
          prioritize building the <i>right</i> thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a regular at various Austin tech meetups and occasionally{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          For what it's worth, I own two degrees from the University of Texas at
          Austin in Computer Science and Journalism.
