I've been building full-stack web apps for more than 15 years across just about every kind of stack and team setup.
These days, I gravitate toward work that pushes on developer experience and architectural clarity â€” things that make
shipping easier without piling on complexity.

I've spent plenty of time in traditional product organizations - owning features, scaling systems, improving dev
workflows - but some of my most meaningful work happened in different lanes. At Fractal Software, I partnered with more
than 50 startup CTOs to help them build from scratch: setting early engineering culture, designing clean architecture,
and building hiring pipelines that actually worked.

On the open source side, I've worked with the RedwoodJS core team, leading the development
of [AutoForm](https://autoform.netlify.app), a tool for schema-based form generation. I'm always looking for
opportunities to get involved with open source projects or collaborative builds with teams who care about the craft. If
that's you, I'd love to connect.
