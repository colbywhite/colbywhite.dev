In order to experiment with various edge technologies, I'm going to be working on a project that hopefully puts them to use.

It's a simple project I call [Power Schedules](https://powerschedules.net/). It takes various power rankings and sport schedules and overlaps them so you can easily see which games are between two good teams and avoid a game between two bottom-of-the-barrel teams.

It's simple but will give me a chance to use solve a real set of problems with the edge. Right now it contains some hardcoded data in a Next.js app deployed on Vercel.

I've actually worked on various incarnations of this idea in the past. (I really don't like watching games that turn out to be boring.) It's served as a real-world chance to try out various tools and frameworks so I'll be reusing the concept here.
